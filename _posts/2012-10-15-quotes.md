>"Being weird to someone just proves that you are being you, which is the most important thing you can ever be. There's nothing wrong with you. There's something wrong with them. They can't understand what it's like to be themselves, much less what it's like to be you."

>Elegance is not optional...There is no tension between writing a beautiful program and writing an efficient program. If your code is ugly, the chances are that you either don't understand your problem or you don't understand your programming language, and in neither case does your code stand much chance of being efficient. In order to ensure that your program is efficient, you need to know what it is doing, and if your code is ugly, you will find it hard to analyse.  
>-- Richard O'Keefe

>The best is the enemy of the good. (It does not promote mediocrity, it (paradoxically) promotes the best that can be done in a given situation.)  
>-- FranÃ§ois-Marie Arouet

>Part of it(practice) is knowing what you want to say, and part is knowing how to say it.  
>-- Peter Norvig

>If you can understand how to write and when to use once-only, then you truly understand macros.
A word to the wise: don't get carried away with macros.  
>-- Peter Norvig

>Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.  
>-- Donald Knuth
